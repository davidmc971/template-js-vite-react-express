# template-npm-start-scripts-fullstack

Just a simple template containing a dev script featuring [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) to run your fullstack app in development.

This *only* contains the `dev` script and placeholders for potentially useful scripts:
- `dev`: This runs the `dev` scripts in `./frontend` and `./backend` with fancy formatting and in parallel.
- `test`: *Placeholder* for a script to run tests across your packages.
- `build`: *Placeholder* for a script build your packages.
- `start`: *Placeholder* for a script start your built packages.

Once you created your repository from this template make sure to create the `frontend` and the `backend` folders in the root of your repository. There you can initialize your packages either from scratch or with a utility like `create-vite`. Afterwards make sure they each contain a `dev` script and you're ready to go! ðŸš€
